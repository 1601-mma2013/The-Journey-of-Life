######-Transfer data online securely.

#####Electrodermal Activity(EDA)
######Electrodermal activity (EDA), is also known as skin conductance and galvanic skin response (GSR), it refers to electrical changes, measured at the surface of the skin, that arise when the skin receives innervating signals from the brain. For most people, if you experience emotional activation, your brain sends signals to the skin to increase the level of sweating. 
#####How does it measured?

### d. User observations

World Health Organisation (WHO) reports that in the last 45 years suicide rates have increased by 60% worldwide. Now, suicide is among the three leading causes of death among those aged 15-44 in both of male and female. Suicide attempts are up to 20 times more frequent than completed suicides. WHO states that mental health disorders especially depression and substance abuse are associated with more than 90% of all cases of suicide.

Besides, The Charles E. Kubly Foundation, a public charity devoted to improving the lives of those affected by depression states that many individuals are more vulnerable to the effects of stress on their mood and depressed, and these cause them have suicidal thinking. Specifically, the cognitive risk factors: interpersonal problem-solving deficits, perfectionism, hopelessness and other distorted cognitions are the causes that influence our mood and potential for suicidal thinking.

Furthermore, an investigation into 130 suicides in people under 20 has revealed bereavement, physical illness, school pressures and bullying were among the themes associated with their deaths. 

More than a quarter of the young people in England whose deaths were considered in the report had expressed suicidal ideas in the week before they died and more than half had previously self-harmed, academics based at the University of Manchester found. Those behind the report said a death by suicide was often not down to one single cause, and could come after a build-up of different stresses. Also, The report, the first stage in a UK-wide analysis of suicides in people aged under 25, identified warning signs in some cases and highlighted the need for the provision of proper support, the Samaritans said.

###a. Context Scenarios

Charlie is the CEO of the company. He has a great idea to help his employee to manage and detect stress level. Nowadays a lot of suicide case happen and it’s getting serious. Charlie is concern about this issues and would like to minimise the suicide cases.

Here is Charlie's context scenario :
Charlie comes out a product which can detect his employee stress level so that his employee could manage their stress. Charlie wanted all of his employees work under a workplace with good management of stress. 
If his employee reach the limit of the stress detector, it means that the particular employee definitely need more concern and care from others. Charlie will provide each of his employees a stress detector and it just look like a watch. It allow his employees to wear it during working hours without notice by clients because it’s exactly like a watch with stress detector function.
This product will remind his employees to calm themselves down while they are in stress. For example, everyone is in agitated state during the meeting or rushing for deadline of the project. If the stress level reach a certain or high level, it will send a notification to Charlie and it’s the time to encourage his employees to get a proper rest. For serious case, Charlie will send a consultant to consult his employees and know what their needs. It will allow Charlie to understand more about his employees. Your number one customers are your people. Look after employees first and then customers last.
